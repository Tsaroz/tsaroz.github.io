                <h2>Binance Co-Founder Responds to Allegations of Listing Fees</h2>
                <img src="binance.jpg" alt="Article Image" class="article-imageb">
                <p>In recent weeks, Binance has been accused of charging exorbitant listing fees for tokens. The accusations included claims that Binance demanded up to 15% of a project's token supply in exchange for listings. These rumors stirred up the crypto community, with many questioning the transparency of Binance's listing process. In response, Binance co-founder Yi He firmly denied these claims, clarifying the exchange's listing policies and emphasizing that no listing fees are required.</p>
                <h3>Allegations of High Fees and Token Demands</h3>
                <p>The accusations came after a social media post by the CEO of Moonrock Capital, who claimed that Binance requested large fees and a percentage of the token supply for a listing. This raised concerns about Binance’s influence and fairness in the industry. These claims, though, were not backed by concrete evidence, leading to widespread speculation among community members.</p>
                <h3>Yi He’s Denial and Explanation</h3>
                <p>Yi He took to social media to clear up the misconceptions, stating that Binance has never required fees or token allocations for listings. She emphasized that Binance’s listing process is based on merit, not financial transactions. Instead of charging projects for listings, Binance focuses on evaluating the potential and viability of tokens, and only a small percentage of applications are approved. She further explained that any contributions made by projects to Binance’s charity initiatives are voluntary and not related to the listing process. This separation between charity and listings, Yi clarified, was often misunderstood, contributing to the confusion.</p>
                <h3>Listing Process and Charity Contributions</h3>
                <p>Binance’s listing process involves a thorough review of a token’s market potential, legal compliance, and the project’s broader impact. Unlike some exchanges that impose significant listing fees, Binance remains committed to listing tokens based on their merit and the value they bring to the ecosystem. Yi He pointed out that Binance is one of the few major exchanges not charging upfront fees for listings.
                    Yi also clarified the role of charity contributions. While Binance does accept voluntary donations from projects to support charity efforts, this has no bearing on a project’s ability to list on the platform. These donations are separate from the review process.</p>
                <h3>Criticism of Other Exchanges and Market Dynamics</h3>
                <p>Yi He compared Binance's practices to other exchanges, particularly Coinbase, which is known for charging listing fees. Some exchanges, unlike Binance, operate on a model where projects must pay substantial sums to get their tokens listed. In contrast, Binance’s listing approach is designed to prioritize the success and credibility of the projects, not the financial benefits of the exchange.
                    As Binance faces increasing competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), the scrutiny over its business practices continues. The ongoing debate over centralized vs. decentralized exchanges reflects the evolving nature of the crypto space, with many questioning how much control centralized platforms should hold over the token listing process.
                    The entire situation highlights the ongoing tensions within the crypto industry over exchange practices and the balance between accessibility and profit-making. With Binance remaining transparent about its policies, it continues to be a leader in the global crypto exchange market.</p>
